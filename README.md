# SimpleHUD

A simple and easy to use HUD complete with a simple and easy to use customizer program to follow.

Recommendations:
1. Do not edit the HUD yourself unless you know what you are doing. If you break it after editing the HUD, don't come crying back to me.
2. Use the customizer. It's there for a reason. Edit the changes you want, and save it. Don't like your changes? Select a backup from the backups tab.
3. Some fonts look a little weird on bigger screens, I'll add support for other resolutions later.
