# SimpleHUD
HUD IS IN BETA, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

A simple and easy edit to the stock HUD, keeping the same look and feel of the default HUD, but making everything centered towards the screen.
Some screenshots can be seen under the `images` folder.

Please read the WIKI of this repository for any information you'd likely need. Thank you.

###### Author's notes:
* This HUD does NOT support minmode as of right now.
* When in a server, looking at the main menu, "Change Scoreboard" will appear. This is fake and does not work. I have no plans for a second scoreboard under minmode.
* Engineer's build and destroy menu's are out of place.
