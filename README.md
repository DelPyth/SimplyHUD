# SimpleHUD

A simple and easy edit to the stock HUD, keeping the same look and feel of the default HUD, but making everything centered towards the screen.
Some screenshots can be seen under the `images` folder.

Notes:
1. Ask me to add something to the HUD and I'll likely do it if it's possible.
2. I shall add customization support later on, for now you can edit the HUD as you please.
3. Something's broken? Something doesn't look right? Something seems off? Ask me and I'll take care of it within a few weeks (busy schedule).
